# flutter_auth0_universal
This Flutter application runs on IOS, Android and Web.  It is written based on clean architecture and uses Auth0 for authentication, BloC for state management and Go_Router for navigation.

Before running this app, make sure you have configured an Auth0 application and created a user on the Auth0 dashboard with your account. You can find instructions in my article [Flutter Web Authentication Using Auth0, BloC and Go_Router](https://medium.com/@reyparma_53717/flutter-web-authentication-using-auth0-bloc-and-go-router-62d7ebc91e7a).
